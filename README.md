# Petricoh Engine

The Engine is the tool that communicates to the libvirt API in order to manage VM's.

To ease the development, this tool provides an HTTP RESTful API to allow for ease of libvirt virtual machine management.

The Goal behind petricoh is to create a system that can provision cloud images in less than a minute using KVM and at the same time, providing RESTful API endpoints to make virtual machine management easy.
